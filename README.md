You're probably on this page because you want to learn web development. Not just one little piece, but ALL of it. 

Or maybe you’re coding already but you want to make BETTER websites?

I was in your shoes once and #### THIS is the course I WISH I HAD. 

#### Welcome to The Complete Fullstack Web Developer Course

This was the first "Complete Web Development" course on Udemy. It's extremely comprehensive and I explain EVERYTHING you need to know, step by step. There's a reason why there are so many "Complete Web Development" courses on Udemy today -- they took what worked and made spin off courses.

Join over 80,000 other students in this massive course! 

This course is designed for every skill level. Whether you're just learning web development today, or you're already a Python Pro, there's lots to learn for everybody! 

Design, develop and launch several websites!

You will develop several projects, a portfolio page for free on GitHub, and lastly an entire website. And I'll teach you how to deploy all of it.

Skip to the part you want to learn

This course was designed for you to either watch in order, or to skip around section-by-section. Maybe you already know JavaScript and don't want to watch it — that's OK! Skip to the next section on APIs, or work on the projects that come after it.

Here's what you'll learn, in this order:

HTML/HTML5
This is the code that 100% of all websites use

CSS/CSS3
This is what makes websites look nice with colours, shapes and more.

Project: Create a Portfolio Page
Using HTML and CSS you'll create a nice looking portfolio page

Project: Create an 8-Bit Style Website
Using more HTML and CSS you'll get even more practice creating a retro-style website

JavaScript
This is what creates interactions and the "fun" parts of a website. This section comes with 6 primary projects and a handful of mini-projects. This includes modern JavaScript, too! 

Project: Create a Modal by Hand
Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript you'll create an internal page popup that looks nice and asks a user to accept or decline the page

Project: Create a Hand Made Calculator
Continue practising your HMTL, CSS and JavaScript skills by creating a nice looking and fully functional web-based calculator

Git
Git and GitHub are core pillars behind collaboration between you and other developers. This is a VITAL skill in modern coding.

Project: Launch your Website using GitHub Pages
GitHub offers a free static site (html/css/js only) service. In about 45 minutes you can launch all your previous work from this course onto the internet.

APIs
Learn how APIs and RESTful APIs work. API's make the world go round. It's how online services talk to other online services

Python
The worlds 3rd most popular coding language, and the hottest language you can learn this year. You'll go from beginner to advanced!

Project: Image Detection Application
Using Python you'll create an image detection application where you can identify objects inside an image

Wagtail CMS
Wagtail CMS is the top content management system for Python. I'm part of the core Wagtail development team so you know you're getting top notch education.

Taught by

Hello! I'm Kalob. I've been developing websites since 1999.

I'm passionate about education and sharing my knowledge with people like you. I love it so much I've started creating MORE courses and I've dedicated a lot of my life to free coaching and building e-learning platforms. 

You wouldn't believe the FREEDOM I've had since I officially changed careers and started making websites, professionally. I've lived in Ireland, , worked in the US, Mexico and the UK, and helped build companies around the world.

And guess what? Everywhere I go I can work because all I need is a laptop and internet.

And I want that for you! Wouldn't it be nice to travel the world and not have to worry about paying your bills? Professional web developers can do that. 

...

Oh, and here's the best part. There are TOO MANY web development jobs and not enough web developers.
